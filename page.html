        <p>Not knowing how you feel right now is absolutely normal. As you develop your awareness of yourself, 
           you are then able to better map out your emotions, 
           figure out your triggers and gain perspective on what you value and how you would like to present yourself.</p>
        <p>Did you know that:-</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Our  inability to identify how we are feeling at a particular moment could suggest that it is a 'cocktail' of emotions? 
                This means that you need to do the work of working through your recent physical and mental experiences in order to figure them out individually, unpack them and work through them?</li><br>
            <li>Due to learned behaviours and thinking patterns from childhood, we could filter acceptable and unacceptable emotions and emotional reactions.</li><br>
            <li>A recent or re-experienced traumatic event can trigger us into 'freeze' mode, where we disallow emotions as a coping mechanism?</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="http://atlasofemotions.org/">Here</a> is a fun tool called the <b>Atlas of emotions</b>. 
           The Atlas of Emotion is a tool to help people better understand what emotions are, how they are triggered and what their effects are, and how to become aware of themselves.</p>
        <p>Below are some articles to check out and give you some thoughts about emotions that we don't know we are feeling:</p>

                It is believed that the purpose of most Taoist Chi Gung is to make your body as relaxed, loose and full of energy as you were as a child. 
                When you feel drained, this is an excellent low impact way of gaining energy while also staying aware of areas where you hold tension and diffusing them. </li>
